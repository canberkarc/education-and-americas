This project explores the influence of economic parameters on educational outcomes in South American countries over the last 20 years. By analyzing key indicators such as GDP, public expenditure on education, and literacy rates, the study aims to uncover the relationships between economic conditions and access to education. Through statistical analysis, I seek to identify patterns that highlight how economic factors have affected educational opportunities in the region during this period.
